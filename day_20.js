Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage

Tasks/Activities:

Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage
Task 1: Write a script to save a string value to localstorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
Task 2: Write a script to save an object to localstorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

Activity 2: Using LocalStorage
Task 3: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to 200mlStorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
Task 4: Write a script to remove an item from localstorage. Log the localstorage content before and after removal.

Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage
Task 5: Write a script to save a string value to sessionstorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
Task 6: Write a script to save an object to session@torage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

Activity 4: Using SessionStorage
Task 7: Create a simple form that saves user Input (e.g., name and email) to sessionstorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
Task 8: Write a script to remove an item from sessionstorage. Log the sessionfitozage content before and after removal.

Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage
Task 9: Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both localstorage and sessionstorage. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
Task 10: Write a function that clears all data from both Somelstorage and sessionatorage. Verify that both storages are empty.

Feature Request:
1. LocalStorage Script: Write a script that saves, retrieves, and removes items from localstorage, and displays the saved data on page load.
2. SessionStorage Script: Create a script that saves, retrieves, and removes items from seastonstorage, and displays the saved data on page load.
3. Storage Comparison Script: Write a script that saves data to both localstucage and sessconitorage, retrieves the data, and compares the results.
4. Clear Storage Script: Create a script that clears all data from both localstorage and sessionstorage, and verifies the operation.

Achievement:
By the end of these activities, students will:
Understand how to use Localstorage and sessionDtorage for persistent and session-specific data storage.
Save, retrieve, and remove data from both localstorage and seastonhtorage.
Implement form data storage using localstorage and sessionstorage.
Compare and contrast the use cases for localstorage and session√§torage.
